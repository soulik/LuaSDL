Notes for SDL_net demo using tcp_client_demo.lua and tcp_server_demo.lua
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For SDL_net testing, you need to run two programs, (1) the client, and
(2) the server.

If LuaSDL is in the win32 directory, you can start them using the
following commands (you might need to add '&' at the end, depending on
which shell program you are using):

	../../win32/luasdl tcp_client_demo.lua
	../../win32/luasdl tcp_server_demo.lua

Once running, press [Space] in the client to transmit some data.

http_reflector.lua
------------------

This can be run from the demo screen or as a stand-alone script. Once
started, try the address "http://localhost/" on your browser, or
"http://127.0.0.1/". On new Win32 operating systems such as XP, please
make sure the LuaSDL executable file is not blocked.
