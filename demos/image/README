Notes
-----

tongue.svg is the original source of the image, which was drawn by me in
Inkscape 0.44. The SVG was then exported to PNG in Inkscape, and from
there The GIMP was used to generate the various files. All the image
files are hereby placed into public domain by the author, Kein-Hong Man
<khman@users.sf.net>.

The TGA file I generated using Gimp doesn't work. Has yet to find out
the reason for it.
